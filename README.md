# todo_tk
A todo list implementation using Tkinter.  I am playing around with some two-way binding design.  No big deal, right?

# tk_todo
Sort of a kanban thingy.  Whatever that means.  Playing around with the finer points of Tkinter.  I plan on connecting this up to a database (maybe SQLite to start) using SQLAlchemy.  Maybe I use Flask to just expose a REST api.  Who knows.  It's a fun/frustrating trip so far.
